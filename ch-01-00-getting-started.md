# Getting started

Let's get started! The aim of this section is to build the working environment,
so you can get comfortable connecting the source-code, dev-skills and theory in
a working context. This takes four stages.

* Acquire project resources (repo and toolchain).
* Configure the Setup.
* Install the bare-bones os161.
* Running os161!
