# First Run!

This is the most exciting part. You have the binaries. You have the utilities. 
Now it's just a matter of running it. Let's get started!

### Tools

In the last section, we created the resources (binaries, file structure, etc)
that os161 runs on. This build runs on the mips CPU architecture, and so we
need to use a tool to emulate the hardware we are running it on. We will use
`sys161` that we installed before. Without going into detail, run
* `sys161 kernel`
and if all goes well, you have your first run of an OS! AWESOME!!!!!

At this point, have a play. Look at the different commands, run `sys161` without
any arguments, and explore.
