# Introduction

Welcome to "os161 project notes". os161 is a teaching operating system designed and built as a core tool-set for learning OS developement. This book will sorve as documentation while you go through content for an example OS course

### Project Aim

Through practical hands-on work

* Be comfortable navigating the code of a simple functioning Operating System.
* Understand key theory, and recognize where to apply them when writing OS code.
* Build software engineering skills through writing OS code.

### Project Approach

This project draws heavy inspiration from UNSW CS3231 - Operating Systems course, and is used as a reference for exercise and theory content. The project will approach exercises and directly related theory concurrantly, with background theory included at strategic points. 

### Assumptions

* git installed
* gcc installed
* Ubuntu 14

As well as that, some useful skills include

* Basic git [Interactive Lessons](learngitbranching.js.org).
* Intermediate C, particularly pointers [High-Quality free course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
* **Basic** assembly, preferably mips.
* Linux terminal TODO: Find good resource
