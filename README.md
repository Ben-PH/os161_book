# Introduction

Welcome to "os161 project notes". os161 is a teaching operating system designed and built as a core tool-set for learning OS developement. This book will sorve as documentation while you go through content for an example OS course

### Project Aim

Through practical hands-on work

* Be comfortable navigating the code of a simple functioning Operating System.
* Understand key theory, and recognize where to apply them when writing OS code.
* Build software engineering skills through writing OS code.

### Project Approach

This project draws heavy inspiration from UNSW CS3231 - Operating Systems course, and is used as a reference for exercise and theory content. The project will approach exercises and directly related theory concurrantly, with background theory included at strategic points. 

### Assumptions

This project assumes that you are familiar with memory layout, particularly the use of pointers in the context of C. It also assumes that you are reasonably comfortable with the prospect of wrtincg C, and being exposed to advanced C code.
